Datasets:
1. Visual Astronomy - https://www.go-astronomy.com/ngc-objects.htm - catalog of NGC objects and their brightness and location
2. Black Holes - List of microlensing events found by Gaia - https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06121
3. Exoplanets - archive of confirmed planets and candidates - https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/

Brainstorm - Visual Astronomy:
Loop through data and determine which are visible one at a time, saving the ones that are

Project ideas - Visual Astronomy:
1. Find visible objects from a location (only above horizon)
2. Find visible objects incorporating weather/time/location/moon, etc using live data or past data and telescope aperture (improve accuracy by increasing data)
